Treat the license for this code as though it were the Apache-2.0 license,
WITH THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS:

existing commandline argument names.

If you add any commandline arguments, they MUST begin with `--layered-`.

I'm sure this lax wording is not legally binding, but please don't be an asshole.
